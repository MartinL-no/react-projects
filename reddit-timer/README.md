# Reddit Timer <br />

## Overview

I created this app as part of course where I had to work within a professional real-world development environment.

Designs were provided via [Figma](https://figma.com/). The project was split into small tasks using [Clickup](https://clickup.com/)/Kanban as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. Then the code was reviewed by a senior developer and checked against automated testing tools such as [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/).

For the project I choose to use React, React Router, Styled-Components and React Hook Form to validate the users input. From working on the project I gained a lot of real world skills in areas such as -

- **Creating [pixel-perfect]((https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixel-perfect-pro/nnhifpoojdlddpnhjbhiagddgckpmpfb)) designs**
- **Planning and implementing a complex UI component**
- **Implementing data fetching with error handling**
- **Debugging inside an IDE**
- **Writing integration tests**
- **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
- **Code reviews**
- **Continuous integration**

The code reviews gave me an insight into a lot of best practices to follow and how to work at a prefessional standard
